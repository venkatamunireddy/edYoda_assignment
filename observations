Summary:
  1.The original pod vote-7d884dd585-8mzvb was deleted successfully.

#Worker Pod Deletion in Kubernetes

Before pod deletion

Pod Information:
  Pod Name: worker-6fc5d5b668-k4bl2
  Function: Processes votes from Redis and updates the final count.
root@ip-172-31-34-4:~# kubectl get po
output:
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
db-58cc845644-mqbd6       1/1     Running   0             34h
redis-6878558678-dqrr2    1/1     Running   0             42h
result-86bc6f7b5d-gwq6n   1/1     Running   1 (34h ago)   42h
vote-7d884dd585-qqgw5    1/1      Running   0             34h
worker-6fc5d5b668-k4bl2   1/1     Running   1 (34h ago)   34h

After pod Deletion:

Delete the Worker Pod
 To delete the pod, run the following command:
  "kubectl delete po worker-6fc5d5b668-k4bl2"
Output:
  pod "worker-6fc5d5b668-k4bl2" deleted

Verify the Current Pods
  "kubectl get po"
output:
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
db-58cc845644-mqbd6       1/1     Running   0             35h
redis-6878558678-dqrr2    1/1     Running   0             43h
result-86bc6f7b5d-gwq6n   1/1     Running   1 (35h ago)   43h
vote-7d884dd585-qqgw5     1/1     Running   0             19m
worker-6fc5d5b668-72rcs   1/1     Running   0             11m

Observations:
  1.After the deletion of the worker pod, a new instance of the worker pod is created automatically by the ReplicaSet. This ensures that the application maintains its desired state with zero downtime.
  2.The new worker pod will have a different name (worker-6fc5d5b668-72rcs), while the functionality remains unchanged.

#Deletion of DB Pod

Pod Information:
  Pod Name: db-58cc845644-mqbd6
  Function: Displays real-time voting results (PostgreSQL Database)
Before deletion of pod
root@ip-172-31-34-4:~# kubectl get po
output:
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
db-58cc845644-mqbd6       1/1     Running   0             35h
redis-6878558678-dqrr2    1/1     Running   0             43h
result-86bc6f7b5d-gwq6n   1/1     Running   1 (35h ago)   43h
vote-7d884dd585-qqgw5     1/1     Running   0             19m
worker-6fc5d5b668-72rcs   1/1     Running   0             11m

After Delete the DB Pod
use the command to delete
  "kubectl delete po db-58cc845644-mqbd6"

Verify the Current Pods
  "kubectl get pods"

output:
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS     AGE
db-58cc845644-qckfr       1/1     Running   0            35s
redis-6878558678-dqrr2    1/1     Running   0            2d22h
result-86bc6f7b5d-gwq6n   1/1     Running   2 (5s ago)   2d22h
vote-7d884dd585-qqgw5     1/1     Running   0            27h
worker-6fc5d5b668-72rcs   1/1     Running   1 (5s ago)   27h
Observations:
  1.New DB Pod: The pod name changed from db-58cc845644-mqbd6 to db-58cc845644-qckfr, indicating that a new instance of the DB pod was created.
  2.Restarted Pods: The result and worker pods have recorded restarts, but their names have not changed. This is normal behavior as these pods are separate deployments and can restart independently based on their configuration.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. complete the assignment by making the result pod work. (if it is not working)
In my node the worker pod is in running state, so again no need to make to any changes.
if the pod is not deployed use the following command "kubectl apply -f podname.yaml".
